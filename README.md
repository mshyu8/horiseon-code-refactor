# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description
This webpage was an on-the-job ticket where my job was to refactor the code. By replacing some of the non-semantic elements with semantic elements, I was able to get rid of some of the repeating code in the css file and make the over all code a lot cleaner and less repetitive. I also added alts to the images.
